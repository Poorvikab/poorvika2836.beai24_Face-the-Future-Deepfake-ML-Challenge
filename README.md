# Face-the-Future-Deepfake-ML-Challenge

# 📌 1. What Is It?

Face-the-Future is a deep learning–based image classification system designed to detect AI-generated (deepfake) facial images.
It uses a fine-tuned EfficientNet-B4 architecture pretrained on ImageNet and adapted to the provided real vs fake dataset.
The model outputs a JSON file with predictions (real / fake) and confidence scores for each test image.

A FastAPI interface is also included for real-time inference — upload an image and get an authenticity prediction instantly.

| File/Folder             | Description                                                                                                                                                                                               
| train.py                | Main training script. Loads and augments the dataset, fine-tunes the EfficientNet-B4 model, and saves the best model as `model_best.pth`.                                                                          
| inference.py            | Generates predictions for the test images using the fine-tuned model. Includes **Test-Time Augmentation (TTA)** for robustness and outputs two JSONs — one for official submission and                              one with confidence scores. 

| app.py                  | A **FastAPI web service** that allows users to upload an image and instantly receive a real/fake prediction with confidence. Runs the trained model as a local API.                                                
| feature_viz.py          | Extracts deep features from the trained model and visualizes them in 2D using **t-SNE** to show how the model separates real vs fake faces in feature space.                                                       
| prepare_labels.py       | Combines individual real/fake label JSON files into a unified `train_labels.json` used for training.                                                                                                               
| model.py                | Defines the **EfficientNet-B4** architecture used for fine-tuning, modifying its classifier layer to output two classes (real/fake).
```
